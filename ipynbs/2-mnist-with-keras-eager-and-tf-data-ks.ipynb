The tf.data API provides tools for working with data (including common functionaltity, like shuffling, batching, etc), as well as high performance utilities (like parallel reads, and pre-fecthing to GPUs) - should you need these down the road. Here, we'll wrap MNIST with tf.data, just to introduce the API.
